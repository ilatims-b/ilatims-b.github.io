    <p>Hi! I'm a sophomore at IIT Madras studying civil engineering. Outside of academics, I spend most of my time exploring why and how deep learning models work, especially transformers. It excites and fascinates me the most. I love math.</p>
    
    <p>I enjoy trekking, travelling, talking to trees, playing badminton, and sketching. (Although these hobbies have been rare since trying to open transformers inside out.)</p>
